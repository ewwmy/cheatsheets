# Cheatsheets

- [JavaScript (en)](./javascript-en.md)
- [Git (ru)](./git-ru.md)

I plan to create my own cheatsheet about **Node.js**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript** and perhaps some other languages, runtimes, frameworks, and technologies.

Feel free to correct me if you find some errors by creating issues.
